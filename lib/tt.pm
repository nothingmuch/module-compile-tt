=head1 NAME

tt - Preprocess Perl code with Template Toolkit and Module::Compile.

=head1 SYNOPSIS


	package Foo;

	# between 'use tt' and 'no tt' the source code will
	# be process by Template Toolkit.

	# This example generates source code for accessors.
	# the specific problem is best solved with L<Moose> or
	# L<Class::Accessor>, but the principal remains the same

	use tt ( fields => [qw/foo bar gorch/] );

	[% FOREACH fields IN fields %]

	sub [% field %] {
		my $self = shift;
		$self->{'[% field %]'} = shift if @_;
		return $self->{'[% field %]'};
	}

	[% END %]

	no tt;

	package main;

	my $obj = Foo->new;

	$obj->bar("moose");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module uses Module::Compile to help you generate Perl code without using
BEGIN/eval tricks and reducing readability, but without having to repeat
yourself either.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

To configure L<Template> either subclass this module and override
C<default_tt_config>, or pass parameters in the C<use tt> line.

Note that due to the way L<Module::Compile> works you must put all the
variables on one use line.

For example:

	use tt INCLUDE_PATH => "/foo";

The default configuration values are:

		INTERPOLATE        => 0,
		EVAL_PERL          => 1,
		INCLUDE_PATH       => [ @INC ],
		LOAD_PERL          => 1,
		DEBUG              => "undef",

This provides a default that is slightly more suitable for templating code than
normal TT defaults. DEBUG_UNDEF ensures that no undef variables are
interpolated, INTERPOLATE being off ensures that perl variables aren't treated
as TT variables by accident, and the other options allow for a more permissive
use of features.

=head1 VARIABLES

Like configuration parameters, you may pass variables on the C<use tt> line.

Variables and configuration options are destingushed - anything that is all
upper case in the use line is considered configuration.

A probably better way to declare variables is simply in the template itself:

	[% foo = "bar" %]

=head1 CAVEATS

Due to L<Module::Compile>'s semantics the use line is actually fudged and
string-evaled by this module, so it might break and you can't refer to
lexicals.

All uppercase parameters on the use line are treated as configuration options.
I may add a list of TT configuration params later on.

=head1 TODO

Add all sorts of useful variables about the package that the template is
processing, the file and line numbers, etc.

Currently L<Module::Compile> doesn't provide enough facilities for this.
